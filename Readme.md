The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repository contains 5 files:

CodeBook.md, a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data. 
Readme.md, this file
run_analysis.R, which includes the R Script for getting the tidy data
tidyDS.txt, which contains train and test observations (only mean and standard deviation variables)
independent_tidy_DS.txt, which contains aggregated data (by activity and subject, using mean as aggregation function)

Replicating tidy data:
To replicate tidy data (to obtain tidyDS.txt and independent_tidy_DS.txt) just download run_analysist.R and execute it in your own R instance. The raw files should be placed in the working directory.
